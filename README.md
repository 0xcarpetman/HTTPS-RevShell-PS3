# Help Revshell-Generator.ps1 (Automatic Payload Generator)

This script allows you to create an executable file with the payload necessary to use HTTP-revshell, you just need to follow the instructions on the screen to generate it. There are 6 predefined templates and a customizable one, with the data that you like.

The payloads generated by the tool, incorporate the legitimate icon of the application, as well as the product and copyright information of the original application. In addition, each of them opens the original application before establishing the connection with the server, pretending to be a legitimate application. This can be used for phishing or Red Team exercises.
